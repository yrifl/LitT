-- ./ -- [ WIP ]

What is this?

My personal Rojo template for developing games, included my own packages <@yrifl/SDN>.

How to use this?

Well, you have to install aftman from <@LPGhatguy/aftman>, and after that clone this repository using `git clone` and finally type this command to install other tools (Rojo, Selene, Wally) `aftman install`. Congratulations, you have your Rojo developer workspace set up! You can continue now to read Rojo documentation <rojo.space/docs> for further development.

Why is Lit?

Because I'm Lit BD.

Thank you, bye.
