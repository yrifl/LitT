What is this?

My personal Rojo template for developing games, included my own packages <@yrifl/SDN>. So you might think, how do I use this template?

Well, you have to install aftman from <@LPGhatguy/aftman>, and after that clone this repository using `git clone` and finally type this command to install other tools (Rojo, Selene, Wally, etc) `aftman install`. Congratulations, you have your Rojo developer workspace set up! You can continue now to read Rojo documentation <rojo.space/docs> for further development. 

List of installed tools: 
	- aftman <LPGhatguy@aftman>
	- moonwave <evaera@moonwave>
	- rojo <rojo-rbx@rojo>
	- wally <UpliftGames@wally>
	- selene <Kampfkarren@selene>
	- stylua <JohnnyMorganz@StyLua>

Thank you, bye.
